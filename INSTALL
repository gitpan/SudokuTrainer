INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

There are several procedures available for installation of Perl modules. It's
recommended that you use the first one in this list that is available in your
Perl distribution. For all of them you will need administative privileges.

1. CPAN
-------
Use the shell command "cpan Games::Sudoku::Trainer".

2. CPANP
--------
Use the shell command "cpanp -i Games::Sudoku::Trainer".

-----------------
For the following installation procedures you need a preliminary step:
Visit the website ??????????
http://search.cpan.org/~adamk/List-MoreUtils-0.33/lib/List/MoreUtils.pm
http://search.cpan.org/xxxxxxx and download the distribution file:

On Linux:   tar -xzf SudokuTrainer-0.000.001-TRIAL.tar.gz
On Windows: Use a ZIP archiver program (e. g. winZIP or 7-Zip) to unpack the
            distribution file.
			
Finally enter the distribution directory:
cd SudokuTrainer-0.000.001-TRIAL

3. Module::Build
----------------
Enter the following commands, depending on your platform:
	  Linux                      Windows
	  -----                      -------
	perl Build.PL              perl Build.PL
	./Build                    Build
	./Build test               Build test
	sudo ./Build install       Build install

4. ExtUtils-MakeMaker
---------------------
This installation procedure is available since the first days of CPAN, and
it is still included in Perl installations. It uses the "make" utility.
However the name of this utility changes slightly depending on the platform.
e. g. on Windows the name is "dmake".

Enter the following commands, depending on your platform:
	  Linux                      Windows
	  -----                      -------
	perl Makefile.PL           perl Makefile.PL
	make                       dmake
	make test                  dmake test
	sudo make install          dmake install
